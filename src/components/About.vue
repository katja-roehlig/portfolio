  <h2>About Katja</h2>
  <p class="about__text">
    The combination of creativity and a logical-analytical approach distinguish
    me. I think through new ideas intellectually and analytically and examine
    them for errors, inconsistencies and feasibility. I recognize patterns and
    apply them to new situations. In doing so, I work strategically and in an
    organized manner. I always keep the big picture in mind, yet pay attention
    to detail and quality.<br />
    I have a very well-developed imagination and a first-class sense of
    aesthetics. A great inquisitiveness also characterizes me. I like to work
    myself into new facts, ideas and concepts and develop from them other
    perspectives, ideas, theories and concepts.
